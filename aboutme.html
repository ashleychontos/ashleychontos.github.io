     <p>A common question asked in academia is</p>
     <p>I, for one, have never been comfortable when confronted with loaded questions like, "Where do you see yourself in 10 years?" or "Why _[this]_ now?" -- mostly because I never had a clear path or idea of what that really entailed. In fact, a majority of my life has been scripted by a go-with-the-flow mentality. Now that I'm older, I imagine this was probably a nightmare from my parent's perspective, which seemed silly, uncertain and impractical.  asked to describe how one ends upA common story within the astronomy community typically includes a younger version of themselves marveling at the sky, aspiring to be an astronaut or wondering how the world works. Nope, not me.</p>
     <p>I was born and raised in the beautiful, scenic Hudson Valley in Upstate NY, just outside the quaint town of Woodstock (yes, the original). Growing up I had done well in math- and science-related classes but our small-town high school didn't offer classes like physics (let alone astronomy/astrophysics). Completely fixated on my legos, building these enormous and detailed home-like creations, I couldn't imagine myself as anything but an architect for most of my childhood. This held true for awhile, where I started imagining and creating actual brueprints of homes as a teenager... just for fun.</p> 
     <p>My parents were quite keen on me going on to college, but as the first in my family to do so, there were several hiccups (i.e. learning experiences) along the way. trajectory into astronomy was nonlinear, beginning after an 8-year-long fashion modeling career based out of New York City. One random day I decided I wanted to go back to school, receiving a B.Sc. in physics and a B.Sc. in mathematics (with focuses on statistics and applied mathematics) from SUNY Albany in 2016. I am very grateful for my undergraduate research experience at Stanford working with <a class="alt" href="https://profiles.stanford.edu/bruce-macintosh?tab=bio" alt="">Bruce Macintosh</a>, who ultimately inspired me to pursue a Ph.D. in astronomy.</p>
